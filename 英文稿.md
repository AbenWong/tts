Hello, everyone! I'm Aben from the ASP team. Welcome to my summary presentation on the short-term assignment in Shanghai. Over the next 10 minutes, I will share with you my experiences and achievements in developing a lightweight decision-making tool for the HBCN CIO department during the past 10 weeks of my short-term assignment. This presentation will be structured around the project background, implementation process, results demonstration, and key accomplishments. I hope that through my sharing, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of my experience during this assignment.

Excellent. Let’s begin by reviewing the project background. The core objective of this 10-week STA assignment was to build a lightweight, information-aggregating decision-making tool for the HBCN CIO.

So, why was this tool necessary? Primarily to address a very practical pain point: during daily reporting and external communications, the CIO often struggled to quickly and accurately access key data, which significantly impacted decision-making efficiency.

On this project, I was fortunate to take on a triple role, acting simultaneously as the technical developer, project manager, and requirements analyst. Of course, this was only possible with the close collaboration and strong support from our team, including our back-end development engineer and requirements review manager.

To ensure the tool's comprehensiveness, we conducted an in-depth analysis of six core operational scenarios. These include well-known areas such as Finance and Budget, Operations and Performance, among others. Our goals were clear: through the implementation of this project, we aimed not only to deliver a functional tool but also to promote the standardization of relevant data definitions, establish a sustainable update mechanism, and lay a solid data and systemic foundation for potential future automation through proof-of-concept validation.
