# Chronicle of a Shanghai Assignment: A Journey from Distant Gaze to Deep Engagement

## I. Departure: A Seed of Aspiration Planted by a Distant View

In February Shanghai, where the chill of spring still lingered, I stood on the observation deck of the International Building. My gaze crossed the sparkling waves of the Huangpu River, fixing directly on the glass curtain wall of the HSBC IFC Building on the opposite bank. This structure, standing tall at the heart of Lujiazui's financial district, boasts clean lines and an air of calm resolve—like a silent medal witnessing the iteration and progress of this international metropolis. At that moment, I was merely a traveler pausing to look into the distance, and a seed was quietly sown in my heart: I wished that one day, I could step into this building, stand at the intersection of finance and technology, embrace unknown challenges, and grow through practical experience. 

I never imagined this accidental expectation would come true so soon. In August 2025, when the STA approval notification popped up on my screen, my hands trembled slightly as I held the phone—I had truly obtained the opportunity for a short-term assignment. I was about to enter the building I once gazed at from afar, deeply participate in business implementation as a technical professional, and unlock a brand-new career journey. On the day of departure, my suitcase was packed with clothes and equipment, and my heart was filled with anxiety and anticipation. I knew this trip to Shanghai was destined to be a rendezvous with my original aspiration, and more importantly, a journey of self-breakthrough. 

## II. Immersion: Multi-Role Challenges and Value Realization

The core task of this assignment was to build a lightweight CIO Decision-Support Dashboard. More than just a simple data aggregation tool, it needed to accurately capture the core data needs of CIOs in their daily work, provide clear data references to support rapid decision-making, and serve as a "visual tool" for the implementation of the group's IT strategy. For me, the biggest challenge of this task was not the technology itself, but the comprehensive breakthrough in roles—I was no longer a "single executor" focused on development in my original team, but simultaneously took on multiple roles as PM (Project Manager), BA (Business Analyst), Technical Leader, and Front-End Developer. 

Initially, switching between roles made me a little flustered: I had to coordinate with the business side to sort out requirements, oversee the team to advance development, and control the details of prototype implementation, often switching back and forth between "coordination and communication" and "coding and development". But it was precisely the experience of these multiple roles that allowed me to break out of a single technical mindset and learn to examine the project from a holistic perspective. After more than two months of intensive work, the CIO Dashboard POC was successfully launched, and the value it created far exceeded initial expectations: 

1. Maximizing the reduction of information transmission costs: Previously, for a piece of core data related to the data center, from the CIO initiating the request to connecting with the relevant data responsible person, it required 5 intermediate links, at least 10 communication documents circulated via email, and the entire process took 3-5 days. After the dashboard was launched, data directly reached the responsible person without email circulation, achieving a leap from "5-person collaboration to 1-person direct access" and "3-5 days to on-demand access at any time". It not only saved the group's labor costs but also pressed the "accelerator button" for the CIO's decision-making efficiency. 

2. Breaking down barriers and unblocking information silos: When sorting out business indicators related to "unit cost", we found that different teams had scattered data sources and inconsistent statistical logic. To this end, I took the lead in connecting with the responsible persons of the two teams, repeatedly communicated and disassembled the business logic, and refined unified calculation formulas and data sources. This not only opened up cross-team information channels but also clarified the subsequent data update frequency and maintenance standards. This is just a microcosm of the 30 core indicators. During the entire business exploration process, multiple teams successively joined in support, learned from each other and integrated deeply through communication, and finally significantly improved the core value of the 30 indicators—achieving a 500% increase in value compared to the initial 5 indicators determined by STA. 

3. Anchoring strategy and realizing value upgrading: This dashboard is more like a "barometer" of the group's IT strategy. Through visual indicator presentation, it can not only quickly align with industry standards and internal bank goals but also dynamically match OKR progress through indicator changes, achieving a dynamic balance between strategy and tactics. It not only makes the implementation of the group's IT strategy more stable and healthy but also provides precise support for the implementation of long-term goals through short-term indicator tracking, helping the group "run steadily and fly faster" on the road of digital transformation. 

## III. Precipitation: Inner Growth Beyond Roles

The most precious gain of this assignment is never the sense of accomplishment from project launch, but the deep-rooted inner growth behind the role change. In the past, I often thought from the single perspective of a technical developer, focusing on code implementation and function optimization, but ignoring the review of goals and values from the overall project perspective; this time, as a PM and BA, I had to take the initiative to connect with different teams, find a balance in demand differences, build bridges in front of communication barriers, truly break out of technical limitations, and learn to promote the project with a holistic mindset. 

I have an increasingly clear understanding that the workplace needs more "T-shaped talents"—those who establish absolute right to speak with one core expertise, and then broaden their ability boundaries through comprehensive development of multiple skills. A true technical leader is a coordinator with this trait, who can efficiently integrate resources, unite the team, and promote the fundamental solution of problems. This mindset of "looking beyond technology" has made me no longer confined to a "code executor", but grow into a "business enabler". 

During this intensive work, I always embraced innovation, took the initiative to explore application scenarios of AI tools, improved the professionalism of AI prompts through deliberate training, and used AI to quickly generate prototype frameworks and sort out business logic, providing strong support for the efficient advancement of the project. Later, I also sorted out these AI application experiences into written documents, forming a reusable methodology to help the team improve the quality and efficiency of subsequent projects. 

Within the business scope, I established a regular dialogue mechanism with multiple business departments and CIOs, deeply understood the core demands and technical pain points of each business line, and gradually figured out the daily work context of CIOs—from data review to strategic deployment, from cross-department coordination to risk control. I tried to think from the perspective of a "mini CIO" and understand the company's strategic development by imitating the CIO's way of thinking. This immersive experience not only made my understanding of the business more three-dimensional and comprehensive but also significantly improved my strategic vision and decision-making judgment. 

Beyond the business scope, I also took the initiative to establish connections with multiple technical leaders, and discussed career development experiences and role transition insights in different situations with them during work breaks. From the strategic planning of personal career roles, the improvement path of core technologies, to agile project management skills, efficient reporting methods, and mental adjustment in different stages of the workplace, their unreserved sharing benefited me a lot. Of course, I also know that these valuable experiences cannot be fully digested and absorbed in just two months. They need to be continuously polished and precipitated through practice in future career journeys to be truly internalized into my own abilities and understand the deep truths behind them.

And this growth is inseparable from the running time on Binjiang Avenue. Every day after work, I would change into running shoes and run along the track by the Huangpu River. The track winds and turns, sometimes passing through the brightly lit Lujiazui, sometimes passing by the lively old docks full of fireworks. Those sudden bends are very similar to the unexpected challenges in the project—the more eager you are to sprint, the easier it is to fall into chaos; only by slowing down, adjusting the rhythm, and moving forward steadily along the curve of the bend can you pass smoothly. 

Just like the process of sorting out business logic in the project, initially facing scattered requirements, I was eager to quickly build a prototype, but repeatedly hit a wall; until one day when running, watching the runners around me cope with the bends calmly, I suddenly had an epiphany: sorting out requirements is like running around bends—only by clarifying the core context first, then gradually refining the details, can we advance efficiently. Those moments of thinking on the track and talking to myself not only blew away the fatigue of work but also made me learn to "precipitate and review" and understand the wisdom of "adapting to the rhythm". 

## IV. Remembrance: Shanghai's Scenery and Warm Friendships

This assignment also made me understand the versatility of Shanghai—it has both the bustling noise of Lujiazui and the historical precipitation of the Bund. After work, I often went for a pleasant building walk in downtown Shanghai with newly met colleagues—shuttling between buildings, feeling the unique charm of Shanghai in the collision between reinforced concrete and historical style; we also met at the food market by the Huangpu River, tasting delicious local Shanghainese cuisine and various foreign foods, letting the taste on the tip of the tongue freeze into warm memories of Shanghai; occasionally, I would go to the Bund on weekends, watching the international buildings and river scenery complement each other, and letting the evening breeze blow away the fatigue of work. 

The most precious thing in this journey is the friendship of walking side by side. We once discussed data logic and business context fiercely in meetings, repeatedly adjusted parameters and verified standards for the optimization of an indicator, and found the optimal solution in the collision of ideas; we also talked freely in a bistro on Halloween night, tasted various delicacies, raised glasses to celebrate every breakthrough in the project and the joint efforts of each other. Under the dim light, laughter and clinking glasses intertwined into the most healing melody; when I fell into confusion due to the pressure of multiple roles, they listened to my troubles patiently and gave thoughtful suggestions, making me feel the warmth of family in a strange city. 

All good things must come to an end. As the assignment approached its end, we had dinner parties again and again to say goodbye. The food on the table was still delicious, but the topics were filled with more reluctance. On the occasion of parting, my friends prepared thoughtful gifts for me—a high-quality baseball cap, a commemorative signature pen, and refrigerator magnets with cute little animals. Each of these carries the friendship of this period of time and has become the most precious souvenir in my luggage. 

In addition to the daily work of deepening in Shanghai, I also took the short weekend time to explore different scenery in surrounding cities such as Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Ningbo, and Suzhou. In Ningbo, I specially went to the morning market of the Old Bund early in the morning, watching fresh seafood neatly arranged, slurping a bowl of hot seafood noodles, and feeling the fireworks and vitality of this port city; in Suzhou, I took a small boat to cruise on the moat around Pingjiang Road, watching the white walls and black tiles on both sides recede slowly, listening to the boatman humming the soft Wu dialect, and encountering the gentleness of Jiangnan among the small bridges and flowing water; in Jiaxing, I wandered by Nanhu Lake, felt the thickness of history beside the Red Boat, took a bite of the sweet Jiaxing zongzi, and tasted the delicate flavor of Jiangnan; in Hangzhou, I walked on Su Causeway against the morning light, watching the West Lake ripple and willows sway gently, and felt the romance of "Above there is heaven, below there are Suzhou and Hangzhou" in the artistic conception of Broken Bridge and Remnant Snow. These short trips not only enriched the assignment life but also allowed me to gain a moment of peace and healing amidst the busy work.

Now, the assignment has ended and I have returned to my familiar city, but the wind of Shanghai, the waves of the Huangpu River, the light and shadow of the IFC Building, the days and nights of working side by side, the joy of the Halloween bistro, the warm gifts at parting, and the fireworks and poetry of surrounding cities have all been deeply engraved in my memory. From the initial longing for the IFC from a distance, to the intensive work of immersive participation, from the warmth of walking side by side to the comfort of exploring alone, this journey made me understand: life is like a long walk, and the people we meet, the roads we take, and the scenery we see will eventually become the power for us to move forward. 

Never forget where you came from, and you can go far. Those days of deepening in Shanghai, those moments of thinking on the track, the growth and friendship gained in collaboration, and the experiences and feelings during the trip have all become the most precious wealth in my life, guiding me to move forward more calmly and firmly towards the next journey in the future.
